Description: systemPipeRdata complements the systemPipeR workflow management
        system (WMS) by offering a collection of pre-designed data analysis workflow
        templates. These templates are easily accessible and can be readily loaded onto
        a user's system with a single command. Once loaded, the WMS can immediately
        utilize these templates for efficient end-to-end analysis, serving a wide range 
        of data analysis needs.
