Description: systemPipeRdata is a helper package to generate with a
        single command NGS workflow templates that are intended to be
        used by its parent package systemPipeR. The latter is an
        environment for building end-to-end analysis pipelines with
        automated report generation for next generation sequence (NGS)
        applications such as RNA-Seq, RIBO-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq and many
        others. Detailed examples for using systemPipeRdata are given
        in systemPipeR's overview vignette.
