  abstract      = "Summary: BWA-MEM is a new alignment algorithm for aligning
                   sequence reads or long query sequences against a large
                   reference genome such as human. It automatically chooses
                   between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end
                   reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is
                   robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range
                   of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For
                   mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance
                   than several state-of-art read aligners to date.
                   Availability and implementation: BWA-MEM is implemented as a
                   component of BWA, which is available at

  abstract = "HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of
              transcripts) is a highly efficient system for aligning reads from
              RNA sequencing experiments. HISAT uses an indexing scheme based
              on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM)
              index, employing two types of indexes for alignment: a
              whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local
              FM indexes for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISAT's
              hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM
              indexes, each representing a genomic region of ∼64,000 bp. Tests
              on real and simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest
              system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than
              any other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT
              requires only 4.3 gigabytes of memory. HISAT supports genomes of
              any size, including those larger than 4 billion bases.",

  author   = "Ziemann, Mark and Kaspi, Antony and El-Osta, Assam",
  abstract = "Genomic alignment of small RNA (smRNA) sequences such as
              microRNAs poses considerable challenges due to their short length
              (∼21 nucleotides [nt]) as well as the large size and complexity
              of plant and animal genomes. While several tools have been
              developed for high-throughput mapping of longer mRNA-seq reads
              (>30 nt), there are few that are specifically designed for
              mapping of smRNA reads including microRNAs. The accuracy of these
              mappers has not been systematically determined in the case of
              smRNA-seq. In addition, it is unknown whether these aligners
              accurately map smRNA reads containing sequence errors and
              polymorphisms. By using simulated read sets, we determine the
              alignment sensitivity and accuracy of 16 short-read mappers and
              quantify their robustness to mismatches, indels, and nontemplated
              nucleotide additions. These were explored in the context of a
              plant genome (Oryza sativa, ∼500 Mbp) and a mammalian genome
              (Homo sapiens, ∼3.1 Gbp). Analysis of simulated and real
              smRNA-seq data demonstrates that mapper selection impacts
              differential expression results and interpretation. These results
              will inform on best practice for smRNA mapping and enable more

              and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash
              table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is
              accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from
              a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped
              alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for
              alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The
              speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to
              the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We
              implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read
              alignment package that is based on backward search with
              Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short
              sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the
              human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both
              base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and
              color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both
              simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x

              portability of data analysis workflows. Our goal is to create
              specifications that enable data scientists to describe analysis
              tools and workflows that are powerful, easy to use, portable, and
              support reproducibility.CWL builds on technologies such as
              JSON-LD and Avro for data modeling and Docker for portable
              runtime environments. CWL is designed to express workflows for
              data-intensive science, such as Bioinformatics, Medical Imaging,
              Chemistry, Physics, and Astronomy.This is v1.0 of the CWL tool
